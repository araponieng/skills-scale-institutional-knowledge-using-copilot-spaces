# Role Onboarding Checklist

This checklist helps ensure clear role assignments and smooth onboarding during team setup and project kickoff.

## Purpose
Use this checklist when:
- Setting up a new project team
- Onboarding new team members mid-project
- Clarifying responsibilities during project kickoff
- Establishing cross-functional collaboration patterns

## Pre-Kickoff: Role Assignment

### Identify Required Roles
- [ ] Determine which roles are needed for the project based on scope and complexity
- [ ] Review [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) to understand responsibilities
- [ ] Identify any role gaps or overlaps

### Assign Core Roles
- [ ] **Project Manager**: Assigned and confirmed
- [ ] **Product Manager**: Assigned and confirmed
- [ ] **Developers**: Team size determined and members assigned
- [ ] **QA/Testing**: Coverage approach defined (manual, automated, or both)

### Assign Extended Team Roles (as needed)
- [ ] **UX Designer**: Assigned if user interface or experience work is required
- [ ] **DevOps Engineer**: Assigned if infrastructure or deployment complexity is significant
- [ ] **Business Analyst**: Assigned if complex requirements gathering or data analysis is needed
- [ ] **Support Lead**: Assigned if customer-facing support or feedback loop is critical
- [ ] **QA Automation Specialist**: Assigned if test automation strategy is a priority

## Kickoff: Role Clarification

### Document Team Roster
- [ ] Create team roster with names, roles, and contact information
- [ ] Share roster with all team members and stakeholders
- [ ] Add roster to project documentation (e.g., README, project charter)

### Review Responsibilities
- [ ] Each role reviews their responsibilities in [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)
- [ ] Clarify any custom responsibilities specific to this project
- [ ] Document any deviations from standard role definitions

### Establish Communication Patterns
- [ ] Define communication cadence (standups, syncs, reviews)
- [ ] Identify primary communication channels (Slack, Teams, email)
- [ ] Map out key team interactions using the "Key Team Interactions" sections from persona definitions
- [ ] Schedule recurring meetings and add to team calendar

### Define Handoffs and Dependencies
- [ ] Map key handoffs between roles (e.g., Design → Development → QA → Deployment)
- [ ] Identify critical dependencies between roles
- [ ] Establish SLAs or turnaround expectations for key handoffs
- [ ] Document handoff procedures in project documentation

## Ongoing: Role Support

### First Week
- [ ] Onboarding sessions completed for new team members
- [ ] Access granted to necessary tools, repos, and documentation
- [ ] Each role has met with their key collaborators (as defined in Key Team Interactions)
- [ ] Initial questions or blockers addressed

### First Sprint/Iteration
- [ ] Each role has participated in their typical communication activities
- [ ] Handoffs between roles have been exercised at least once
- [ ] Any role ambiguities or conflicts have been surfaced and resolved

### Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Include role clarity as a topic in retrospectives
- [ ] Update role definitions based on project learnings
- [ ] Refine handoffs and communication patterns as needed

## Tips for Success

- **Start with the minimum viable team**: Only add roles as complexity requires
- **Clarify early**: Address role ambiguities during kickoff, not mid-sprint
- **Document handoffs**: Make implicit collaboration patterns explicit
- **Review regularly**: Use retrospectives to refine role definitions and interactions
- **Flexibility matters**: Roles may wear multiple hats in smaller teams—document those overlaps

## Questions or Issues?
