# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to OctoAcme's standardized project management documentation. These guides provide a comprehensive framework for managing projects from initiation through retrospective, helping teams deliver customer value efficiently and consistently.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a **customer-first, iterative delivery** approach that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and continuous improvement. Our project management framework is designed to support cross-functional teams delivering product features, services, and integrations with transparency and quality.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

### Core Principles
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments to learn and adapt quickly
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has defined roles and accountabilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Foster an environment that encourages feedback and learning

### Key Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and business context

### Project Lifecycle
1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Scope work, identify resources and dependencies, create release plan
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate on deliverables
4. **Release**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and announce to stakeholders
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and identify continuous improvement opportunities

### Key Artifacts
- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, and success metrics
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: High-level timeline and milestone overview
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done**: Quality standards and completion requirements
- **Risk Register**: Identified risks, impacts, and mitigation plans
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items for improvement

### Communication Cadence
- **Weekly PM/PdM sync**: Alignment on priorities and risk management
- **Twice-weekly standups for delivery team**: 15-minute sync on progress, blockers, and dependencies (or as agreed)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Progress reports and milestone reviews
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: As needed for critical issues and blockers
